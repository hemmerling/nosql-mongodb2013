At some directories, there are files with name xxx_zip.txt, where xxx.zip is the name of a database file. The database files are just available as separate download, at SourceForge ( http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/nosql-mongodb2013 ).

It's because
- The database files ( .json, ... ) were supplied by the original course, but needed for the execution of the code
- There is the need to have multiple copies of database files, in different directories.
- The database files are quite large, so some are beyond the file limit of this repository ( 100 MBytes ).
- You should always separate code from data :-).

If you want to process the code, you must first dearchive the zipped database file in that directory.
